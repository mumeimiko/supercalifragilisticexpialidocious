Hello

quick read me.
The way this study guide was suppose to be used, you are suppose to download the repo in your local machine that has access to a kubernetes cluster. You then access the chapters folders individually and read the 00____.md file for the chapter and then run the commands in that chapters folder. 

Almost all chapters have an exercise.md file in which you can use to run quick exercises for that chapter and then look at the answers folder for the answers to the excercise file.
